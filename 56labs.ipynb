which is on offer in scotland and wales  saying it was  unsustainable .  david rogers  from the local government association  said agencies were working together on the kind of innovation proposed by the government. and tony hunter  president of the association of directors of social services  said the plans could improve dignity and well-being for thousands of people. but age concern argued social care was chronically under-funded and older people were being offered choice in principle  but not in practice. its director general  gordon lishman  said:  direct payments will not work if there are no services for people to choose from locally.   the tories say people who pay for three years  long-term care directly or through insurance should be guaranteed free care for the rest of their lives. tory spokesman simon burns said more than 80 000 long term care places had been lost since 1997.  after eight years of persistent change  dogmatic enforcement of regulation  and overbearing government initiatives - we need action  not a vision   said mr burns. the lib dems say they would fund free personal care by a new 50% tax rate on incomes over \\u00a3100 000. health spokesman paul burstow said:  promoting independence sounds good and helping people to live in their own homes is a goal we share.  but the risk is that independence can turn into isolation if the right support and care is not available.\",\n          \"beer giant swallows russian firm brewing giant inbev has agreed to buy alfa-eco s stake in sun interbrew  russia s second-largest brewer  for up to 259.7m euros ($353.3m; \\u00a3183.75m).  alfa-eco  the venture capital arm of russian conglomerate alfa group  has a one-fifth stake in sun interbrew. the deal gives inbev  the world s biggest beermaker  near-total control over the russian brewer. inbev bought out another partner in august 2004. inbev brands include bass  stella artois  hoegaarden and staropramen. it employs 77 000 people  running operations in over 30 countries across the americas  europe and asia pacific.  the leuven-based brewery said it would own 97.3% of the voting shares and 98.8% of the non-voting shares of sun interbrew. the deal is expected to be completed in the first quarter of 2005. inbev was formed in august 2004 when belgium s interbrew bought brazilian brewer ambev. sun interbrew  which employs 8 000 staff  owns breweries in eight russian cities - klin  ivanovo  saransk  kursk  volzhsky  omsk  perm and novocheboksarsk. there are also three breweries in ukraine  in the cities of chernigov  nikolaev and kharkov.\",\n          \"athens memories soar above lows well  it s goodbye to another olympic year and as usual there were plenty of highs and lows in athens.  obviously  there s no getting away from the differing fortunes of kelly holmes and paula radcliffe. but i want to remind you of a few more events that made 2004 another year to remember - or forget - for athletics.      one of my favourite olympic moments was kelly s success in the 800m.  winning that race was the key to her success because if she won that then the 1500m would be a bit of a formality. kelly had been full of  should i  shouldn t i   thoughts about going for the double in athens. i thought why wouldn t you do the 800m  it s your best event  it was such good fun to commentate on her 1500m and it was nice to be able to be part of her athens story.      the victory for the british men s 4x100m relay team was a bit of a surprise but a great climax to the games. i think the four of them - jason gardener  darren campbell  marlon devonish and mark lewis-francis - knew deep down that it was their best chance of a medal. the lads had run poorly in the individual sprints so maybe they did lift their game when they knew something was really at stake.      hicham el guerrouj s olympic double is a much bigger achievement than kelly s on a global scale.  he was the first man since for 80 years to win both the 1500m and 5 000m titles. as soon as he had added the 5 000m crown and i had finished commentating  i jumped up  ran down the stairs  pushed everyone out the way and just gave him a big hug. he is one of the few african runners who has embraced the tradition of the mile and he loves to hear all the roger bannister stories. hicham is someone i enjoy having a bit of time with  even though my french and his english are not very good.      what happened to paula in athens this year is the obvious low on a personal level and for the expectations of the nation as well. there were a set of circumstances around athens that conspired to produce a very dramatic ending which i think has been greatly misunderstood. dropping out of the marathon was the right thing to do but starting in the 10 000m five days later was not wise. that was her heart and not her head reacting. paula had a lot of little things going wrong in her preparation and on the day.  things like niggling injuries  not being able to do all her running sessions and feeling the pressure of the race looming ahead of her. i think she came to the start line in athens physically and emotionally drained. and if even the smallest thing doesn t feel right when you are preparing to race a marathon  10 miles down the road it will hit you like a brick wall. the positive thing to take from paula s olympics it that she will have learned a lot from it and so will a lot of people - including me.      purely as a race  paula s victory in the new york marathon has to go down as one of the most thrilling. it was so nip-and-tuck between her and kenya s susan chepkemei and you don t usually get that kind of excitement in marathons. it was also a real delight for all athletics fans because  to use one of my favourite words  paula showed real  bouncebackability . and it was a bit of a rarity for me too because i genuinely did not have an inkling how the race was going to pan out.      kelly and the 4x100m boys  victories papered over the cracks in the general performance of the british team. we should be concerned that we re not producing enough people who are capable of reaching finals at senior level.  the only individual men s finalist on the track was michael east in the 1500m. i am beginning to look down and wonder where are the new breed  and that s where things begin to look even gloomier for british athletics as we did not win any medals at the world junior championships in italy. dani barnes came fourth in the 1500m and she was the highest finisher for team gb. the thing is if we don t have athletes getting into the finals at junior level then it really doesn t look good for the beijing olympics and beyond.      i tell you what i really enjoyed this year  benita johnson winning the world cross country championships back in march. in the absence of paula  we tend to think of the event as something of an african preserve. so to have an australian come up and deliver such a surprise was something special.      to be honest  i m getting bored with all the drug scandals  especially balco. i just wish the whole thing would come to a head so we can move on.  having said that  i m always pleased when drugs cheats are caught because it shows the sport is standing up to it and not turning a blind eye anymore. and one of the positive things to come out of balco is people are starting to blow the whistle. we need more people to come forward and help the authorities kick out the cheats. as regards the case against greek sprinters kostas kenteris and katerina thanou  well suspicions have been hanging over kenteris for a while. the bottom line is we cannot keep letting drugs damage the sport because if we do then it stops everyone enjoying it.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

elderly care control elderly and disabled people would choose how their own budget for personal care was spent and organised under government plans.  ministers say elderly and disabled people themselves  not social workers  should be able to decide on their care and stay in their own homes. they also plan a supremo for adult services in each english area to get different agencies working together. but the government shunned opponents  calls for free long-term care.  there are 1.7m people needing care in england and ministers suggest the number could quadruple by 2050. monday s consultation paper on social care for adults in england is aimed at ending a system which generates dependency. health minister stephen ladyman said:  this document is the antithesis of the nanny state.   it s about taking power away from the state and giving it to individuals and saying that we will help you make these decisions but we are not going to make them for you any more.  the government has already allowed local councils to give people money so they can pay for their services directly but take-up of the scheme has been  disappointing .  ministers say the new plans would make direct payments simpler and try to counter reluctance in some local councils to use the payments. they also want to set up a new  half-way house  where social workers tell people how much money is available for their care and help them choose how to spend that  individual budget . the scheme will be funded on existing budgets set until 2008. but mr ladyman said the plans could deliver savings in some areas  such as freeing up nhs beds and preventing illnesses. he ruled out free personal care in england - which is on offer in scotland and wales  saying it was  unsustainable .  david rogers  from the local government association  said agencies were working together on the kind of innovation proposed by the government. and tony hunter  president of the association of directors of social services  said the plans could improve dignity and well-being for thousands of people. but age concern argued social care was chronically under-funded and older people were being offered choice in principle  but not in practice. its director general  gordon lishman  said:  direct payments will not work if there are no services for people to choose from locally.   the tories say people who pay for three years  long-term care directly or through insurance should be guaranteed free care for the rest of their lives. tory spokesman simon burns said more than 80 000 long term care places had been lost since 1997.  after eight years of persistent change  dogmatic enforcement of regulation  and overbearing government initiatives - we need action  not a vision   said mr burns. the lib dems say they would fund free personal care by a new 50% tax rate on incomes over \\u00a3100 000. health spokesman paul burstow said:  promoting independence sounds good and helping people to live in their own homes is a goal we share.  but the risk is that independence can turn into isolation if the right support and care is not available.\",\n          \"beer giant swallows russian firm brewing giant inbev has agreed to buy alfa-eco s stake in sun interbrew  russia s second-largest brewer  for up to 259.7m euros ($353.3m; \\u00a3183.75m).  alfa-eco  the venture capital arm of russian conglomerate alfa group  has a one-fifth stake in sun interbrew. the deal gives inbev  the world s biggest beermaker  near-total control over the russian brewer. inbev bought out another partner in august 2004. inbev brands include bass  stella artois  hoegaarden and staropramen. it employs 77 000 people  running operations in over 30 countries across the americas  europe and asia pacific.  the leuven-based brewery said it would own 97.3% of the voting shares and 98.8% of the non-voting shares of sun interbrew. the deal is expected to be completed in the first quarter of 2005. inbev was formed in august 2004 when belgium s interbrew bought brazilian brewer ambev. sun interbrew  which employs 8 000 staff  owns breweries in eight russian cities - klin  ivanovo  saransk  kursk  volzhsky  omsk  perm and novocheboksarsk. there are also three breweries in ukraine  in the cities of chernigov  nikolaev and kharkov.\",\n          \"athens memories soar above lows well  it s goodbye to another olympic year and as usual there were plenty of highs and lows in athens.  obviously  there s no getting away from the differing fortunes of kelly holmes and paula radcliffe. but i want to remind you of a few more events that made 2004 another year to remember - or forget - for athletics.      one of my favourite olympic moments was kelly s success in the 800m.  winning that race was the key to her success because if she won that then the 1500m would be a bit of a formality. kelly had been full of  should i  shouldn t i   thoughts about going for the double in athens. i thought why wouldn t you do the 800m  it s your best event  it was such good fun to commentate on her 1500m and it was nice to be able to be part of her athens story.      the victory for the british men s 4x100m relay team was a bit of a surprise but a great climax to the games. i think the four of them - jason gardener  darren campbell  marlon devonish and mark lewis-francis - knew deep down that it was their best chance of a medal. the lads had run poorly in the individual sprints so maybe they did lift their game when they knew something was really at stake.      hicham el guerrouj s olympic double is a much bigger achievement than kelly s on a global scale.  he was the first man since for 80 years to win both the 1500m and 5 000m titles. as soon as he had added the 5 000m crown and i had finished commentating  i jumped up  ran down the stairs  pushed everyone out the way and just gave him a big hug. he is one of the few african runners who has embraced the tradition of the mile and he loves to hear all the roger bannister stories. hicham is someone i enjoy having a bit of time with  even though my french and his english are not very good.      what happened to paula in athens this year is the obvious low on a personal level and for the expectations of the nation as well. there were a set of circumstances around athens that conspired to produce a very dramatic ending which i think has been greatly misunderstood. dropping out of the marathon was the right thing to do but starting in the 10 000m five days later was not wise. that was her heart and not her head reacting. paula had a lot of little things going wrong in her preparation and on the day.  things like niggling injuries  not being able to do all her running sessions and feeling the pressure of the race looming ahead of her. i think she came to the start line in athens physically and emotionally drained. and if even the smallest thing doesn t feel right when you are preparing to race a marathon  10 miles down the road it will hit you like a brick wall. the positive thing to take from paula s olympics it that she will have learned a lot from it and so will a lot of people - including me.      purely as a race  paula s victory in the new york marathon has to go down as one of the most thrilling. it was so nip-and-tuck between her and kenya s susan chepkemei and you don t usually get that kind of excitement in marathons. it was also a real delight for all athletics fans because  to use one of my favourite words  paula showed real  bouncebackability . and it was a bit of a rarity for me too because i genuinely did not have an inkling how the race was going to pan out.      kelly and the 4x100m boys  victories papered over the cracks in the general performance of the british team. we should be concerned that we re not producing enough people who are capable of reaching finals at senior level.  the only individual men s finalist on the track was michael east in the 1500m. i am beginning to look down and wonder where are the new breed  and that s where things begin to look even gloomier for british athletics as we did not win any medals at the world junior championships in italy. dani barnes came fourth in the 1500m and she was the highest finisher for team gb. the thing is if we don t have athletes getting into the finals at junior level then it really doesn t look good for the beijing olympics and beyond.      i tell you what i really enjoyed this year  benita johnson winning the world cross country championships back in march. in the absence of paula  we tend to think of the event as something of an african preserve. so to have an australian come up and deliver such a surprise was something special.      to be honest  i m getting bored with all the drug scandals  especially balco. i just wish the whole thing would come to a head so we can move on.  having said that  i m always pleased when drugs cheats are caught because it shows the sport is standing up to it and not turning a blind eye anymore. and one of the positive things to come out of balco is people are starting to blow the whistle. we need more people to come forward and help the authorities kick out the cheats. as regards the case against greek sprinters kostas kenteris and katerina thanou  well suspicions have been hanging over kenteris for a while. the bottom line is we cannot keep letting drugs damage the sport because if we do then it stops everyone enjoying it.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"clean_text\",\n

marley...  to mark the 60th anniversary of the birth of reggae star bob marley  rob partridge - marley s former head of press at island records - remembers the man behind the legend.  partridge worked with marley from 1977 until the jamaican musician s death in 1981.  :  i joined island records in 1977 and the first week i was there i worked on his show at the rainbow theatre. it was one of the last dates he did in london.   : the album exodus came out in 1977 and that provided five hits and confirmed his global superstar status.  by 1979 he was the biggest touring attraction in the world. i remember going to see dates in milan and turin and they were enormous concerts.   : bob was one of the most mesmeric people i ve ever had the privilege to work with.  he must have had an iron will to succeed. bob was a very driven individual. you realised from the start there was a manifest destiny within him that he believed in. he didn t suffer fools gladly. at the risk of stating the obvious  he was an extraordinary song writer and his stage act was perhaps the greatest i ve ever seen. i saw him many times.   :  i recall in 1978 he came to the uk for top of the pops and a daily mirror journalist did a half-hour interview. it was interrupted to do a rehearsal. he came back into the dressing room to resume the interview but saw a world cup match on tv.   he sat down in front of the tv and after 10 minutes it was obvious he wasn t going to move. that was the end of it. the mirror had a very truncated interview.  the last time i saw him was in london in 1980. i arranged for him to play four days of football indoors in fulham.  bob was a good player. we are talking about jamaican-style football. he was an attacking midfield player. his team assembled wherever his gigs were. we played in brazil against some world cup-winning players.   : it was always a struggle for him to connect with black america. reggae did not correspond with disco in the 70s. but bob in the 1990s became one of the great icons in america and the third world.  in 1991  ten years after his death  he sold more records than at any time during his life.  we saw black america taking bob into their hearts for the first time.   :  bob  in worldwide terms  is the greatest music star there has ever been. if you went to africa he would be recognised everywhere  in places john lennon or elvis wouldn t be.  no disrespect to the other artists but a case can be made for him as the greatest  the best and the most influential artist in popular music.   : well 1981 was to be the year he toured africa with stevie wonder. he had only performed in zimbabwe and guinea before.  of course the 1981 tour never happened  but the whole of africa would have embraced him. we can t speculate but he was at the height of his powers and just 36 years old. i had no sense his career was going to go downhill.   :  bob was endlessly optimistic about the way africa would turn out. he realised that nothing was perfect but he had total belief in the power of mankind.  i m sure if he were alive today he would believe africa would firstly become politically free and secondly be able to defeat the aids epidemic.   :  the final tune of his final album was redemption song - one of the most incredible classics of all time.\",\n          \"ukip outspent labour on eu poll the uk independence party outspent both labour and the liberal democrats in the european elections  new figures show.  ukip  which campaigned on a slogan of  say no to europe   spent \\u00a32.36m on the campaign - second only to the conservatives  \\u00a33.13m. the campaign took ukip into third place with an extra 10 meps. labour s campaign cost \\u00a31.7m  the lib dems  \\u00a31.19m and the greens  \\u00a3404 000  according to figures revealed by the electoral commission on wednesday. much of the ukip funding came from yorkshire millionaire sir paul sykes  who helped bankroll the party s billboard campaign. critics have accused the party of effectively buying votes. but a ukip spokesman said labour and the conservatives had spent \\u00a310m between them on the last general election.  with the advantages of public money the others have  the only way the smaller parties can get their message across is by buying the advertising space   he added.\",\n          \"ex-pm lord callaghan dies aged 92 former labour prime minister lord callaghan has died on the eve of his 93rd birthday.  he passed away at home in east sussex  just 11 days after his wife audrey died aged 91. lord callaghan  who leaves a son and two daughters  was the longest living former british pm in history. he entered downing street in 1976 after the resignation of harold wilson. prime minister tony blair called him a  giant  of the labour movement. he held each of the major offices of chancellor  home secretary  foreign secretary and prime minister during his career and became lord callaghan of cardiff in 1987.  chancellor gordon brown said the former pm would be  mourned throughout the world .  it was a commitment to public service that brought jim callaghan into parliament in 1945  and while jim rose to the top he never forgot his roots.  former cabinet colleague lord hattersley said his first reaction on hearing the news was  immense sadness .   it was not a major surprise - i knew what a blow the death of his wife audrey was a few days ago   he said.  he was a decent kindly man who helped me and my generation of politicians immensely.   the labour party and the country will be poorer without him.  conservative peer lord heseltine said that despite their political differences  he and lord callaghan became friends.  you don t get to the premiership unless you have a streak of determination   he said.  but i saw the other side of jim callaghan  he became a personal friend in a way  and my family and i were very fond of him.  tory leader michael howard said he would be remembered with  affection and respect . liberal democrat leader charles kennedy said:  when i was first elected in 1983 as the youngest mp  he was the  father of the house  and as such took a very keen interest in my early days in parliament.   he was always full of warmth and wisdom.  born in 1912 and educated at portsmouth northern secondary school  lord callaghan became a clerk at the inland revenue. he enlisted in the royal navy in 1942 and rose to the rank of lieutenant. elected for a cardiff constituency at the 1945 general election  he represented cardiff seats for more than 40 years. after serving as a junior minister in the attlee government  he became chancellor of the exchequer when labour returned to power in 1964.  with sterling under pressure  he resisted devaluation for three years  before being forced into it in 1967. his political career was not without controversy. when he refused to support prime minister harold wilson and dame barbara castle over the latter s trade union manifesto  in place of strife  in 1968  he said:  i am not going to resign. they will have to throw me out . when home secretary  he ordered british troops to march into the streets of belfast to protect catholic civilians amid rising violence - a decision that has dominated british politics into the 21st century.  as foreign secretary in the early 1970s  lord callaghan kept an open mind about the uk s entry into the common market  seeing the advantages of the uk s entry. he once travelled to idi amin s uganda in 1975 to plead for the life of a british lecturer  dennis hills  who was under a death sentence for treason.  his political life was often tempered by battles against the hard left of the party. in the autumn of 1978  before the  winter of discontent  when trade unions carried out strikes that brought the country to a standstill  lord callaghan refused to hold an early election which may have delivered a labour victory. as garbage lay uncollected in the streets and hospital staff  council workers and even gravediggers stayed off work  lord callaghan failed to predict the mood of the country. when britain went to the polls in 1979  tory leader margaret thatcher was swept into power in a landslide victory  and lord callaghan resigned as labour leader.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n

miss out on the net by 2025  40% of the uk s population will still be without internet access at home  says a study.  around 23 million britons will miss out on a wide range of essential services such as education and medical information  predicts the report by telecoms giant bt. it compares to 27 million  or 50%  of the uk  who are not currently online. the idea that the digital divide will evaporate with time is  wishful thinking   the report concludes.  the study calls on the government and telecoms industry to come up with new ways to lure those that have been bypassed by the digital revolution. although the percentage of britons without home access will have fallen slightly  those that remain digital refuseniks will miss out on more  the report suggests. as more and more everyday tasks move online and offline services become less comprehensive  the divide will become more obvious and more burdensome for those that have not got net access  it predicts.  the gap between  have-nets  and  have-nots  has been much talked about  but predictions about how such a divide will affect future generations has been less discussed. bt set out to predict future patterns based on current information and taking account of the way technology is changing. optimists who predict that convergence and the emergence of more user-friendly technology will bridge the digital divide could be way off mark  the report suggests.  internet access on other devices tends to be something taken up by those who already have it   said adrian hosford  director of corporate responsibility at bt. costs of internet access have fallen dramatically and coverage in remote areas have vastly improved over the last year but the real barrier remains psychological.  there is a hard rump of have-nots who are not engaging with the net. they don t have the motivation or skills or perceive the benefits   said mr hosford.  as now  the most disadvantaged groups are likely to remain among low income families  the older generation and the disabled.  those on low incomes will account for a quarter of the digital have-nots  the disabled will make up 16% and the elderly nearly a third by 2025  the report forecasts. organisations such as bt have a responsibility to help tackle the problem  said mr hosford. the telco has seen positive results with its everybody online project which offers internet access to people in eight deprived communities around britain. in one area of cornwall with high levels of unemployment  online training helped people rewrite cvs and learn skills to get new jobs  explained mr hosford. such grassroot activity addressing the specific needs of individual communities is essential is the problem of the digital divide is to be overcome  he said.  if we don t address this problem now  it will get a lot worse and people will find it more difficult to find jobs  education opportunities will be limited and they ll simply not be able to keep up with society   he said. the alliance for digital inclusion  an independent body with members drawn from government  industry and the voluntary sector has recently been set up to tackle some of the issues faced by the digital refuseniks.\",\n          \"lions blow to world cup stars british and irish lions coach clive woodward says he is unlikely to select any players not involved in next year s rbs six nations championship.  world cup winners lawrence dallaglio  neil back and martin johnson had all been thought to be in the frame for next summer s tour to new zealand.  i don t think you can ever say never   said woodward.  but i would have to have a compulsive reason to pick any player who is not available to international rugby.  dallaglio  back and johnson have all retired from international rugby over the last 12 months but continue to star for their club sides. but woodward added:  the key thing that i want to stress is that i intend to use the six nations and the players who are available to international rugby as the key benchmark.  my job  along with all the other senior representatives  is to make sure that we pick the strongest possible team.  if you are not playing international rugby then it s still a step up to test rugby. it s definitely a disadvantage.   i think it s absolutely critical and with the history of the lions we have got to take players playing for the four countries.  woodward also revealed that the race for the captaincy was still wide open.  it is an open book   he said.  there are some outstanding candidates from all four countries.  and following the all blacks  impressive displays in europe in recent weeks  including a 45-6 humiliation of france  woodward believes the three-test series in new zealand will provide the ultimate rugby challenge.  their performance in particular against france was simply awesome   said the lions coach.  certain things have been suggested about the potency of their front five  but they re a very powerful unit.  with his customary thoroughness  woodward revealed he had taken soundings from australia coach eddie jones and jake white of south africa following their tour matches in britain and ireland.  as a result  woodward stressed his lions group might not be dominated by players from england and ireland and held out hope for the struggling scots.  scotland s recent results have not been that impressive but there have been some excellent individual performances.  eddie in particular told me how tough they had made it for australia and i will take on board their opinions.  and scotland forward simon taylor looks certain to get the call  provided he recovers from knee and tendon problems.  i took lessons from 2001 in that they did make a mistake in taking lawrence dallaglio when he wasn t fit and went on the trip.  every player has to be looked at on their own merits and simon taylor is an outstanding player and i have no doubts that if he gets back to full fitness he will be on the trip.  i am told he should be back playing by march and he has plenty of time to prove his fitness for the lions - and there are other players like richard hill in the same boat.\",\n          \"china continues rapid growth china s economy has expanded by a breakneck 9.5% during 2004  faster than predicted and well above 2003 s 9.1%.  the news may mean more limits on investment and lending as beijing tries to take the economy off the boil. china has sucked in raw materials and energy to feed its expansion  which could have knock-on effects on the rest of the world if it overheats. but officials pointed out that industrial growth had slowed  with services providing much of the impetus. growth in industrial output - the main target of government efforts to impose curbs on credit and investments - was 11.5% in 2004  down from 17% the previous year.  still  consumer prices - at 2.4% - rose faster than in 2004  adding to concern that a sharp rise in producer prices of 7.1% could stoke inflation. and overall investment in fixed assets was still high  up 21.3% from the previous year - although some way off the peak of 43% seen in the first quarter of 2004. the result could be higher interest rates. china raised rates by 0.27 percentage points to 5.8% - its first hike in nine years - in october 2004.  despite the apparent rebalancing of the economy the overall growth picture remains strong  economists said.  there is no sign of a slowdown in 2005   said tim congdon  economist at ing barings.  china s economy is not only gathering speed thanks to domestic demand  but also from soaring sales overseas. figures released earlier this year showed exports at a six-year high in 2004  up 35%. part of the impetus comes from the relative cheapness of the yuan  china s currency. the government keeps it pegged close to a rate of 8.28 to the us dollar  - much to the chagrin of many us lawmakers who blame china for lost jobs and competitiveness. despite urging to ease the peg  officials insist they are a long way from ready to make a shift to a more market-set rate.  we need a good and feasible plan and formulating such a plan also needs time   national bureau of statistics chief li deshui told reuters.  those who hope to make a fortune by speculating on a renminbi revaluation will not succeed in making a profit.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\":

that surround foreign involvement in china s media sector. this is despite beijing s decision to open the state-dominated sector to international investment.  as well as traditional broadcasting  chinese and foreign entrepreneurs alike see fortunes waiting to be made in new media  like mobile services and online gaming. mobile games already account for 15% of revenues from china s 340 million mobile users.  online gaming sales are predicted to top a billion us dollars next year  according to the uk-based journal screen digest. the video market is also seen as a big opportunity  although piracy levels are still very high despite an anti-piracy drive during the past year. in the cinema industry the deployment of digital screens is being accelerated. this is not just to modernise venues but also to curb piracy and regulate distribution. li ruigang  president of the commercial broadcaster shanghai media group  told the conference that china s new media market  is already experiencing explosive growth . it was particularly strong in charged broadband services and mobile value-added services. leading china-watcher  and founder of the cga consultancy jeanne-marie gescher  agreed that the time was ripe for foreign media groups to tap china s huge media market potential.  china s media are now driven by investors who do not care how people consume media - they just want people to consume more of it   mrs gescher concluded.\",\n          \"muslim group attacks tv drama 24 a british muslim group has criticised the new series of us drama 24  which is about to be aired on sky one  claiming it portrays islam unfairly.  the muslim council of britain has complained to broadcasting watchdog ofcom. it says the programme breaches editorial guidelines. the group s members met with sky executives on tuesday after viewing previews of the first five episodes. the drama  now in its fourth series  begins on sunday evening. the new series portrays a muslim family as a sleeper terrorist cell. the muslim council of britain said in a statement:  we are greatly concerned by the unremittingly hostile and unbalanced portrayal of muslims in this series of 24 based upon a preview of the first five episodes that we have seen.   there is not a single positive muslim character in the storyline to date. at a time when negative stereotypes of muslims are on the increase we feel that sky - as a major uk broadcaster - has a responsibility to challenge these insidious views  not help to reinforce them.  but sky denied the programme breached broadcasting guidelines. a spokesperson said:  during a useful meeting yesterday  sky listened to the concerns raised by representatives of the council. sky does not believe that the episodes that it has reviewed to date breach ofcom s programme code.  fox tv  which shows the series in the us  is broadcasting public service announcements showing muslims in a positive light after complaints about the series.\",\n          \"player burn-out

intensity of professional rugby union hits players.  injuries are part of the sport but we have to have a look at the amount of injuries that occur in the english season   robinson told bbc sport.  i think players are probably going to have three or four years taken off their careers.  robinson will be missing an entire midfield for the six nations with the likes of jonny wilkinson  mike tindall and will greenwood injured.  rugby union has become far more physically demanding since the game went professional nearly 10 years ago. as a result three of the major stakeholders in english rugby have launched an  injury audit  to find out how players are coping. the audit is jointly funded by the professional rugby players  association  the rugby football union and premier rugby. as far as robinson is concerned its findings must not be ignored.  i think there s an injury audit coming out in march that s got some great information in there that i think everybody in the english game has got to look at   he said.  if we don t the situation is going to get worse and not better  so i think rugby as a whole has got to look at this.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n
